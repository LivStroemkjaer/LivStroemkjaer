👋 Hi, I'm Liv, a recent graduate from UCPH with a master's in Public Health Science.

📕 My thesis delved into spousal bereavement, utilizing causal inference and prediction models with nationwide registry data.

🚀 Projects:  Check out my latest project on Spousal Bereavement, where I apply data science to understand the impact of loss of a spouse on the need for home care services.

💊 Work: As a health economist at NHTA, I specialize in market access, real-world evidence (RWE), biostatistics, and health economics.
